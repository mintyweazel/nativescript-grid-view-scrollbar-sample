# nativescript-grid-view-scrollbar-sample
A sample project for displaying a scrollbar with NativeScript-Grid-View

![demo](https://raw.github.com/wiki/mintyweazel/nativescript-grid-view-scrollbar-sample/images/screenshot.gif)

## Motivation

An android view [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView), which is nicely wrapped by a great plugin [Nativescript-Grid-View](https://github.com/PeterStaev/NativeScript-Grid-View), cannot show a scrollbar programatically in a native way.(for details, see <https://github.com/PeterStaev/NativeScript-Grid-View>)

It is, however, actucally be possible to display a scroll bar with the [Label](https://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/classes/_ui_label_.label) view.
This repository provides the way to do this for reference.
